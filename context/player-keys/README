Ask each player to generate a public/private key pair and send you the public
key.

Store their public key in this directory.

Make sure the filename extension is ".pub" and the rest of the name contains
only alphanumerics, periods, and underscores.  Any names that start with an
underscore are for "administrative use" -- they cannot be used by a GM or
player to connect to the MapTool server.  Instead, they generate a shell
prompt that can be used for diagnosing and correcting problems.

Run the "activate.sh" script is the parent directory any time a change is made
to this directory (adding or removing keys or replacing an existing key with a
new one).
