= Container Creation

:source-highlighter: rouge

This document describes the components needed to create a standard virtual
machine or container for the _Massive MapTool Server_ project.

== Required Components

The resulting image (either a virtual machine or container) will require:

. The desired version of _MapTool_ (current is 1.9.2)
. The SSH daemon (tested with `openssh-server v7.6p1`)

Optional components include:

. AsciiDoc (`pandoc 1.19.2.4`; for converting this document into HTML)

== Docker Configuration File

Use the following file as the `Dockerfile` for creating the image.

[source,conf]
----
include::Dockerfile[]
----

// Look into using a remote context.  Essentially, create a repo with
// everything needed, including a Dockerfile, and tell `docker build` to use
// that repo.  It'll `git clone` the repo and pass it as the build context.
